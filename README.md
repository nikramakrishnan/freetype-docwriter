2. Running tests on the currently installed Python version.

They are detailed below.

### Test using Tox

To test on both py27 and py36:

1.  Make sure `tox` is installed:
    ```bash
    pip install tox
    ```

2.  Ensure both py27 and py36 are installed.

3.  Run tests:
    ```bash
    tox
    ```

### Test on single python version

To test on current python version using pytest:

1.  Make sure `pytest` is installed:
    ```bash
    pip install pytest
    ```

2.  Run tests:
    ```bash
    python -m pytest
    ```

## License

This library is licensed under the [FreeType License](https://www.freetype.org/license.html).

## History

This library was originally written by David Turner as `docmaker` which collected and presented
documentation in HTML. It has since been modified multiple times, including a major refactor
to allow multiple output formats. The current `docwriter` is the biggest rewrite, with lots of
changes, additions etc. that allow it to be more flexible, readable, maintainable and usable.
